### Intro to Object-Oriented-Programming
> 1. CLASS
 - Two characteristics of the object
   - **state:** head_size? number of legs? wings? ... software object store it in **variable**. 
   - **behavior:** fly? bite? carry? ... softeware object expose it with **methods**.
 - Then what's CLASS ??
   - CLASS is a sort of a **template** or a blueprint for creating **object**.
   - why CLASS? Because..the data_types(float, String,..) are limiting. CLASS could be a powerful **user-defined data_type**, sort of an extra data_type.
 - How to write CLASS?
   - **public**: An "access modifier" to determine **what access** we want to allow others to have to this new class that we're creating...so 'public' means **unrestricted access**.
   - **private**: When talking about variables(fields), an "access modifier"-'private' means, we want "encapsulation"(which is a key fundamental rule of object-orientated programming). So encapsulation in Java is used to hide the fields and methods from access publicly.
   - First, create some variables(fields) that are parts of this CLASS (this takes place in the file different from the main class file). 
   - If you recall, CLASS is just a template. We need to create an object that will take that template. We go back to the **main class**  `class Main()`, create the object name(consider this name as the new user-defined datatype) and say `new` to initialize it. It's like we create the object based on the template 'CLASS'.
